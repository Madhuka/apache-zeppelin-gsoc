# Apache Zeppelin 
Zeppelin is a collaborative data analytic and visualization tool for distributed, general-purpose data processing systems such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink. It has two main features, the data analytic phase and the data visualization phase. This project is an improvement or a re-design of the Data Visualization Component. It successfully eliminates all the limitations and drawbacks of the existing charting visualization component.
